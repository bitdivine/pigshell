iframe(1) -- display content in iframe
======================================

## SYNOPSIS

`iframe` [-o <opts>] [-W <width>] [-H <height>] [-a <sopts>] [-g] <template> [<obj>...]<br>
`iframe` [-o <opts>] [-W <width>] [-H <height>] [-a <sopts>] [-g] -s <tstr> [<obj>...]

## DESCRIPTION

**iframe** displays HTML content in a sandboxed iframe and passes it objects
from its arguments or from standard input. In the first form, if <template> is
a path, **iframe** sets the `srcdoc` property of the iframe to the contents of
<template>. If <template> is a URL, then the URL is directly set as the `src`
of the iframe. In the second form, the supplied string is used as the `srcdoc`
of the iframe.

Communication between the **iframe** utility and the child iframe follows the
following convention:

  * After the `onload` event of the child iframe fires, **iframe** calls
    `window.postMessage()` on the iframe as many times as there are input
    objects.
  * Each message consists of a single Javascript object containing two
    properties: `opts` and `data`. `opts` contains a Javascript object
    obtained by parsing <opts>, specified in the options(7) format.
    `data` contains the input object.
  * The child iframe may issue a `postMessage` consisting of a single
    Javascript object to the parent. The only supported property in the
    "returned" object is `height`, which is used to communicate its height to
    the parent. On receipt of this message, **iframe** adjusts the height
    of the iframe element appropriately to avoid scrollbars.

The following options are available:

  * `-o ` <opts>:
    Options in the options(7) format which are passed to the child iframe.
  
  * `-W ` <width>:
    Width of the iframe, in pixels or as a percentage.

  * `-H ` <height>:
    Height of the iframe, in pixels or as a percentage. If specified, the
    height is not readjusted on receipt of a message from the child iframe.

  * `-a ` <sopts>:
    Comma separated list of sandbox options. These can be one or more of
    "same-origin", "scripts", "forms", "popups", "pointer-lock",
    "top-navigation". They correspond to the "allow-x" attribute values of the
    "sandbox" property of the iframe. By default, <sopts> is assumed to be
    "scripts". Note that options specified are not additive to the defaults;
    `-a same-origin,scripts` must be specified in case both "allow-same-origin"
    and "allow-scripts" attributes are desired.

  * `-g`:
    All input objects are gathered into an array which is passed in to the
    child iframe. Only one message is sent in this case.

## DIAGNOSTICS

The **iframe** command exits with `true` on success and non-`true` if an error
occurs.

## EXAMPLES

Plot countrywise life expectancy statistics to a world map template.

    $ cat http://bitdivine.com/sample/life-expectancy.html | table2js -e "table.wikitable tr" foo country data | iframe -g /usr/template/d3-worldmap1

Display a D3 example (no input data).

    $ iframe -a 'same-origin,scripts' http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/3883245/ </dev/null

Subvert D3 example above to display our own data.

    $ echo "date,close\n1-May-08,10\n1-May-10,40\n1-Jun-12,100\n1-May-13,70" | csv2js | iframe -gs $(cat http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/3883245/ | to text | jf 'x.replace(/d3.tsv.*{/, "window.addEventListener(\'message\', function(e) { var data = e.data.data;")')

## SECURITY

IFrames are placed in a sandbox to minimize security issues with running unknown
code. Opening up privileges, especially `top-navigation`, must be done with 
care as it can result in the iframed-content breaking out of the sandbox and
accessing all content mounted within _pigshell_.
